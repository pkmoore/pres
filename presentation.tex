\begin{frame}{Environments}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Programs don't execute in isolation}
  \item{They operate on the inputs they are provided}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textit{We are really good at testing by manipulating inputs!}}
    \end{itemize}
  \item{\textit{In the context of the environment they are executing in}}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{How Can Environments Differ}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Hardware the application is running on}
  \item{Conditions on the network the application relies on}
  \item{Differing versions of libraries and software dependences}
  \item{Differences in Operating System State}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textit{e.g.\ filesystem state}}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Different Environments Reveal Different Bugs!}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{An application may fail if a file it depends on isn't present}
  \item{An application may fail if the filesystem isn't configured as
      expected}
  \item{An application may fail if the network performs differently than expected}
  \item{These bugs are hard to find because setting up different environments is
      expensive}
  \item{Weird environmental conditions may be uncommon so developers don't
      know that they need to handle them!}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The Cost!}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Applications are often tested under ideal conditions}
  \item{These bugs often will not present themselves until an application has
      been deployed to the weird environment in question}
  \item{What is needed is a way to test how applications will respond when they
      encounter weird environmental conditions \textbf{BEFORE} they make it to
      go through a real world deployment}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{CrashSimulator}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{CrashSimulator is a set of techniques and a tool for:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{Generically capturing and encoding weird environmental conditions}
    \item{Injecting these conditions into an execution of an application under
        test}
    \item{Making an assessment about whether the application handled the
        weird behavior correctly or not}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The Key Idea}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{In a modern setup, an application interacts with its environment
      through the operating system}
  \item{This is accomplished through system calls}
  \item{The results of these system calls represent weird environmental conditions}
  \item{e.g. Poor network performance may involve network-related system
      calls timing out}
  \item{Weird filesystem issue may result in filesystem-related system
      calls failing or returning weird results}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{The Process}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Record system call trace of application running in anomalous
      environment}
  \item{Analyze system call trace to identify system call results are
      indicative of the anomalous conditions}
  \item{Influence execution of application under test such that it experiences
      the identified anomalous system call results}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Injecting Behavior into an Execution}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Record trace of application under test}
  \item{Perturb trace so it now contains anomalous system call results}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{Some mutations can be done programmatically}
    \item{Some mutations require manual effort (at this time)}
    \end{itemize}
  \item{Replay execution of application using mutated trace}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Replaying a System Call Trace}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{Execute application}
  \item{At every system call pause execution and modify registers and memory
      to reflect values present for corresponding system call in trace}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assessing Application's Response}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{If an application changes its system call behavior, replay diverges it may
      be trying to handle the anomalous behavior}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textit{possibly correct behavior}}
    \end{itemize}
  \item{If an application does not change its system call behavior, replay
      continues}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item{\textit{Application has not made an effort to handle anomalous conditions}}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
